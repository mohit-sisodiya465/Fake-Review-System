# Multilingual Fake Movie Review Detection System

## Problem Statement

In today’s digital landscape, online reviews play a critical role in influencing user decisions, especially in the entertainment industry. However, the credibility of review platforms is under threat due to the growing presence of fake reviews, which can be either human-written for promotional/sabotage purposes or AI-generated using advanced language models. Existing fake review detection systems are mostly limited to English language content and lack the ability to detect synthetically generated reviews across diverse languages.

This project addresses the urgent need for an intelligent, scalable, and language-agnostic system by developing a Multilingual Fake Movie Review Detection System. The system is capable of processing reviews in English, Chinese, Japanese, and Turkish, identifying fake content—whether written by humans or generated by AI—through a combination of language detection, machine translation, sentiment analysis, feature extraction (TF-IDF & BERT), and classification using Logistic Regression.

By incorporating both real and AI-generated reviews into training and leveraging state-of-the-art NLP techniques, the system offers a robust solution for maintaining the integrity of user-generated content across global review platforms.

## Description

Description: An NLP-based system that detects fake movie reviews across English, Chinese, Japanese, and Turkish. It identifies whether a review is human-written or AI-generated using language detection, translation, sentiment analysis (Longformer), feature extraction (TF-IDF + BERT), and Logistic Regression. The system is trained on a hybrid dataset combining real and GPT-generated reviews for robust classification and cross-lingual performance.

## Performance Overview of ML Models Leveraged

<p>The Multilingual Fake Movie Review Detection System leverages Logistic Regression as the primary classifier, trained on a hybrid feature set that combines TF-IDF vectors and contextual BERT embeddings. This model achieved an accuracy of 93.75%, demonstrating strong performance in detecting both AI-generated and human-written reviews across multiple languages.

The inclusion of BERT embeddings significantly enhanced the system's ability to capture deep semantic patterns, especially in translated and AI-generated content, where traditional lexical features fall short. When compared to a baseline TF-IDF-only Logistic Regression model (which achieved ~84% accuracy), the hybrid model showed a clear improvement in precision, recall, and overall classification balance.

An experimental configuration using Random Forest with BERT embeddings reached approximately 92% accuracy but incurred higher training time and complexity. Logistic Regression was preferred for its efficiency, interpretability, and balanced performance.

In conclusion, the hybrid model (TF-IDF + BERT + Logistic Regression) offers the best trade-off between accuracy, speed, and multilingual adaptability, making it well-suited for scalable fake review detection in real-world review platforms.</p>
