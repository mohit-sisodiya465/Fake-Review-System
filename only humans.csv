"""It's nothing new that HBO always have the most ambitious projects around, but from 2011 to 2019 they gradually built what I consider the epitome of quality television, and made history. The highly talented show-runners David Benioff and Dan Weiss took the unadaptable giant books by George R. R. Martin and transformed them into this beautifully constructed show, that something of it's kind was never done before. There are so	many layers to this	""story"," so m""	any chara	cters and story arcs intertwini	ng with each oth	er	that	it	se	ems imposs	ible	to	gra	sp	one ma	n cam	e up	with	it all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"																			",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The story Martin created is probably one of the better and most detailed and well-crafted stories of all times, and David and Dan's transformation of the story to the TV medium was beautifully handled. There aren't that many shows when you sit and watch an episode and savor every single scene, if it's the content itself or the many small details that were precisely designed for every frame you watch. It takes a little time to	get into the show	in the begin	""ning"," jus""	t because it's very different f	rom what we are	ge	neral	ly	use	d to. It's	one	of	tho	se	shows	that	from	the	""very first episode until the last it's just one big story so you just need patience to get used to everything that's going on in there", and after that enjoyment is guaranteed. Above all, the thing the show benefited perhaps the most of is the fact that ever since the day they started writing the first script- the complete story from start to finish was compiled in George's head. Not all the details and specifics of course, but the outline and major plot points were invented years ago when he started working on this huge book series, therefore the production knew exactly where to start, where the story is heading and where it ends, which gave consistency to the story from episode 1 to 73," without getting lost in the way with loose threads.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"																			",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The show gets plenty of criticism for its deviations from the source material season 5 and onwards, but if you just think for a second how enormous this story is it's pretty easy to realize a lot needed to be altered to fit the TV medium, and David and Dan managed to do so while preserving the original essence of Martin's creation, keep the story well constructed and coherent and keep dozens of millions of viewers satisfied,	and not only a hand	ful of hard	core foll	owers that wanted it to be a pa	ge- to-page adap	ti	on of	th	e n	ovels. Whi	le I	enj	oye	d a	ll the	book	s an	d did	""n't agree with a few of the changes they made for the show as well I can see why a lot had to be cut", things don't work the same in books as in television. Considering they knew the ending from the start and the huge amount of details you have to alter just from omitting one storyline if you want to reach the same final goal as the books, I believe it was overall for the best and they knew what they were doing," the story didn't collapse under their hands- at least as far as I'm concerned.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"																			",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"HBO really brought their A-Team of directors to handle this show, as you'll find not a few episodes here that would rival works of highly acclaimed cinematic directors with 10 times the budget, whether it's a giant action episode or a well-made drama piece. The production values of the show, like many other things- again, unrivaled by anything else. If it's the locations, effects, production design, costumes, you name it- it'	s not for nothing i	t's the most	Emmy Awa	rded show of all times by such	a large margin.	Th	e fac	t t	he	show takes	plac	e i	n a	fa	ntasy-	medie	val	world	""gives it an edge in that matter", but the impeccable level of detail the behind-the-curtains crew puts in every frame makes it head and shoulders above everything else on TV, if not also big-budget Hollywood productions. One of the most prominent aspects of this show in my opinion is Ramin Djawadi's masterful score which must be one of the most brilliantly unique works ever for a series (whether it's a series of movies or TV series) not only because of the compositions themselves, which are exceptionally beautiful, but also for how the music evolves throughout the seasons and builds the world of the show hand to hand with the writing, the characters and the setting as the story progresses. Also, the way each motif of the music identifies with a certain aspect of the story, though mostly noticeable in later seasons," tells a complete story on its own. Never seen anything like it.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"																			",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The fact that the show is consisting of so many different characters in different locations, with different story arcs that all, eventually, intertwine with each other only adds to the re-watchability value of the show as a whole.

"Say what you will about the final seasons, it's amazing the show started to really divide the fan base only in its very last season, that being it's eighth one- something that is ultimately unavoidable with something in that magnitude of popularity, that has so many characters and storylines for people to nit-pick from. We've seen it with the Sopranos. We've seen it with Seinfeld. We've seen it countless other times- if your	show is popular eno	ugh and you	give the	audience an ending which is any	thing but most c	on	venti	ona	l c	onclusion	possi	ble	#NAME?	""r","	god fo	rbid","	an	endin	g which is little bit brave- you are going to get the heat. We probably must address the elephant in the room", which is the controversy around the final season, even though I truly believe it'll all be gone in the wind in a few months. As I said it's expected some will be disappointed with the way elements of the story have concluded but I believe people went way overboard and overreacted with their negativity and scrutiny towards these final episodes," something that originated heavily from being swept by the negative buzz on social media. A lot of plot points that were deemed by a lot of people as """"""""making no sense"""""""" from the characters perspective are", at least in my opinion, totally in line with their arcs on the show if you give a moments thought about it. After you come to the season with that approach it's pretty fun to enjoy it, having the most ambitious battle ever filmed for television directed by the amazing Miguel Sapochnik, few heartbreaking moments, the destructive and highly impressive fifth episode and most of all beautiful conclusions to arcs we've been following for the past 8 years. In a show this popular, when it came to writing the ending to all these story arcs it seems nowadays a writer has two choices- giving the internet audience what they always wanted and predicted or just going with your vision and making a brave ending actually staying true to the show and it's characters- which is exactly what David and Dan did. Though if you choose the latter option, be sure you are ready to take all the heat- and GoT is not merely the first example of that on television in the last couple of decades. I don't think there was anything as pop-culture as GoT in it's early seasons," and with the social media and internet meme-culture so present these days- this time this phenomenon was taken to heights never seen before.""",,,,,,,,,,
"																			",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After re-watching the show for the first time after knowing how it concludes, the ending makes even more sense. All the arcs are building up beautifully towards the endgame, and it make you understand better some of the choices they made along the way, knowing where it all intended to go. It also makes you understand some of the characters better, and re-contextualizing a lot of things you thought while watching the show the	first times around.

The	re are fa	ntasy elements; most notably th	ree dragons belo	ng	ing t	o D	aen	erys Targa	ryen;	th	e W	hit	e Walk	ers (	the	Army	""of the Dead); and magic of Melisandre", the Red Woman but for the most part things are gritty and real.

The cast does a phenomenal job; this includes many established actors as well as up and coming stars and people for whom this was their first acting job such as young actresses Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams who play Sansa and Arya Stark who's characters develop across many seasons in ways one wouldn't imagine when it started. There is also a stellar performance from Peter Dinklage who plays dwarf Tyrion Lannister; a character that dominates just about every scene he is in despite his diminutive size.

The special effects are fantastic; one could almost believe that dragons are real after watching this.

This has everything one could hope for in a show and more. The brilliant world created here has kings, warriors, slaves, giants, beasts, magic and what not, and yet	seems very real. E	very action	has conse	quences. I guess this justifies	why it took Geo	rg	e R.R	Ma	rti	n so many	years	to	wr	ite	the b	ooks	thes	e are	""based on. Everything about the show is wonderful- that is untill they ran out of the story from the books. I haven't read the books this is based on. But I could clearly feel that some thing has changed drastically since season 6. This series suddenly seemed like any other series. For me", the show has been severely degrading since then. There have been some great moments and good episodes. But the over all story seems random. It feels like they are planning these great moments and fights," and then randomly connecting the dots in between. It is very frustrating to see such an awesome show end so badly.""""","human""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""The best TV show till date .I think it's matchless TV series and best cinematic achievement ever. Great storytelling and character development combined with amazing visuals. Every frame is a work of art, almost every frame is a masterpiece. Overall, this show is simply beyond compare. In Game of Thrones, you will find everything you want, from the importance of family, to politics, to brutal, realistic war, romance and so mu	ch more.

Also, it's though it falls under the fantasy genre it has great humor, good action seen, plenty of romance," humongous amount of politics and lots more. Although in season 8 the ending was quite tragic but seems a little dissapointing. It's definitely a must watch show and shouldn't be missed #gameofthrones""""","human""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""Definitely one of the best fantasy series ever. I don't think I ever saw a better one. At least I can't remember a better one. I write this after the seventh season and it's still as good as the beginning. That's says it all. The acting is excellent. There are so many different characters, clans and families that it could be difficult to follow if you didn't pay attention. But all the characters are worth watching, every sin	gle one of them. An	d don't get	too attac	hed to a character because it c	ould be over for	h	im or	he	r i	n any epis	ode.	Nev	er	saw	so ma	ny ma	in c	harac	""ters being killed or murdered as in Game Of Thrones. And that's a real good thing because there is always an element of surprise. In every season characters that you would think will survive die. The battles are epic", the story could go in any direction anytime. Betrayals, violence, conquests, incestuous affairs, the show has everything.
